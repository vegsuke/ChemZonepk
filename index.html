        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paint is defined as a coating material in liquid or solid which when spread on a surface
                  adheres and hardens forming a film that protect, decorated or add a specific feature to the surface on which it is deposited.
                  It is most commonly used to protect, preserve, decorate or add functionality to an object or surface by 
                  covering it with a pigmented coating

            <br>
               &nbsp;&nbsp; Color has fascinated culture throughout history,
                every age and every region has produced dyes and pigment depending on the available resources.
                Color has been with us for more than 20,000 years.The evidence can be found in the cave paintings. 
                The tradition of painting in Indian subcontinent grew and develope dover time, resulting in a hilly developed and finest style,
                 incorporating the culture and faith of there gionand religion.
                The history of Indian Paint Industry is a sold as the history of the Indian people.
                Indian paints always embrace rich colors and clear symbolism, using specific iconography to make religious figures clearly recognizable
                .The Indian paint industry has recently completed lOO years of manufacturing.
                 Manufacturing of Indian paints started around 1902. <br>

                 The World paint industries has seen a gradual shift in the preferences of people from the traditional white wash to higher quality paints like mulsions and enamel paints.
                 Growing popularity of new variants providing improved finishing and textures,
                 increasing precipitin come of people and efforts on the part of manufacturers to introduce improve diversions like eco-friendly,
                 odour free and dust and water resistant paints, have propelled the growth of the paint markets.
                 Paint manufacturers are giving due attention to consumer’s color preferences.
                 The market is witnessing introduction of break through technologies improve the paint quality.
                 Paint companies are also increasingly investing in their R&D, to carve out a differentiated product in the market.
                 For instance, paints, which use water in place of solvent, have been introduced in the market.
                 They are better in performance and not harmful for health as it emits little or no Volatile Organic Compounds(VOC).
                 The industry has also seen the introduction of solar reflective coating,
                 which is a roof surface coating that lowers the surface temperatures of the roof resulting in to greater comfort in side the building.
                 New technologies in the paint market would lead to better performance,
                 cost reduction and wider applications of paints.
                 The world Paint Industry is only segment of the world chemical industries that has been sharing a consistent doubled growth rate in the last five years.
                 The growth rates recorded over the last few years have been extremely encountered

    &nbsp;&nbsp; The main Purpose of the Solvent (Thinner) is to adjust
    the viscosity of the paint. It is volatile and does not become part of the paint film. It can also 
    control flow and application properties, and affect the stability of the paint while in liquid state.
    Its main Function is as the carrier for the non volatile components.
